            "content": "Multitasking as a Graduate Student . By nature we can process different things at the same time. We can do multiple tasks on the same day. Usually we can prioritize different tasks according to our schedule. Our procedure to handle different tasks might be different and this is usually affected by our experience and the nature of the tasks. . As a PhD student I usually work on different projects. It is becoming essential for me to organize my time such that I don’t cramp myself with different duties. Usually, If I only have one task I start doing it early. For instance, if I have a submission after one week, regardless if it needs a lot of work or not, I start early. This allows me to improve my work and look at it from different angles. The quality increases dramatically when I start early as opposed to doing everything in just one day. Early scheduling increases your working hours but it gives the chance to work less in a day as well as resolve issues that might emerge. Furthermore, procrastinating things till the last moment might be catastrophic especially if you discover that the allocated time was not enough. . Usually, when working on different tasks you have to organize your time carefully. For instance, I might have a paper submission, presentation, coding and writing articles. I start first by prioritizing the things that are very important. But prioritizing doesn’t mean doing them first but allocating more span of time. For instance, paper submission will take a lot of time so I might take one week with two hours a day to work on it. On the other hand, writing an article might take two hours to finish. It is important to recognize these things earlier and allocate the time and effort. This allows me to work on different things on the same day. For instance, two hours writing a paper, three hours coding and half-hour to work on the presentation. The next day I might remove the less important thing which might be the presentation and work on the article. . Working on different things is important because it gives your mind some space for resting. The different tasks I mentioned have different properties. Writing a paper for instance requires a lot of mental power. While the presentation is easier, I might watch an entertaining video at the same time. It is essential not to work on many things that require a lot of mental concentration on the same day. Moreover, working on different tasks gives the impression of success because finishing one task will make you happier. A failure or closed door on one task motivates you to work on another task. . While working on different tasks is important it has its downsides. You have to be careful not to overkill yourself with lots of long tasks in parallel. For instance, working on three projects where each one takes more than a month might be a bad idea. Indeed, it depends on the capacity of the person because some people have the strength to do it. Others are forced because they are ordered to work on these tasks. If you have the chance, limit yourself by knowing your capabilities. Moreover, don’t work on multiple projects that consume a lot of mental and physical power. Try to keep balance between these things because it will wear you out. . Some people have different strategies when working on different tasks. One might prefer finishing one task at a time. But, from experience it is important that you know how much time each task will need. If the allocated time is less, it will have bad ramifications. That’s why I don’t prefer this approach. It might be interesting to consider a hybrid approach where you finish some tasks that are more important and work on less important tasks in parallel. Indeed, with experience you know your capacity and it is up to you to decide the best approach. .",

            "content": "Optimization in Real Life . As a researcher in computer science I try to create a resemblance between the concepts I study in machine learning and real life. Machine learning has a lot of maths but let us just ignore that and focus on high level concepts. Generally speaking, in machine learning the pipeline consists of a model, an objective function and an algorithm that attempts to maximize/minimize the objective function. The algorithm makes changes to the parameters of the model in order to achieve near-optimal results. But, how is that related to real life ? . In real life, we are in some way or another choosing our actions in order to optimize an objective function. As we learn to walk, we try to reduce the possibility of colliding our legs together and fall miserably. In simple terms, we are trying to minimize the objective function which calculates risk of falling. As we enter the war of the stock market we are trying to maximize the objective of earning money. The design of an objective function in real life is usually easy. However, the algorithm we take to do that might be long and rewarding or sometimes short and unethical. You might spend many years trying to learn about how the stock market works. You attempt to ask experts, learn more about stock models and possibly take some courses. However, as humans we are usually lazy. We try to do shortcuts which might allow us to ascend faster in our competition towards fame and popularity - maximize our objective function - but on the other hand we might go to jail if we don’t follow the law. In real life there are regularizers: upper/lower estimators that limit our algorithm to maximize and minimize the objective function. Health is a regularizer, you might get sick and stop earning money for a period of time. There are many other regularizers like time, family, law, etc. In our journey, we try to reduce these regularizers but they are there and we have to deal with them. . Theoretically speaking, we can design different algorithms to optimize objective functions. You can earn money by working as a doctor, engineer or like me in academia. Each one of us made that choice and we are trying to maximize our earning through our choice of design. Early on your career you might have chosen to go through college, graduate and then get a job. In your second year you decided that your design was incorrect, you dropped out college. We make these choices all the time; we might get lucky and succeed and more frequently we might fail and retry. As humans we are stubborn and try to navigate different routes into optimizations. . Sometimes, the design of an objective function is not in our hand. In a world where millions of people use social media, we don’t have much choice. These objective functions have been designed carefully by social media creators to encourage people to look for efficient algorithms for optimization. Our objective mostly is predetermined through a lot of flashy words: likes, retweets, views, favorites, followers, connections, etc. The creators of social media were very smart in designing these objectives. As you create your first account, you try to optimize these numbers because everyone does. Take twitter for instance, lots of likes, means lots of followers, verified, popular, sponsorships, ads and then wala you hit the jackpot. Content creators are forced to ask for likes, subscriptions, views, clickbaits in order to make money. . Our definition of right and wrong is changing according to different metrics in social media. Have you ever changed your way of tweeting because you didn’t get much likes? If a certain tweet will get you 1000 likes will you do it? regardless of the ramifications. Say, you are a creator on youtube and you made a video that got you only a couple of views. Then you made a completely different video that got you thousands of views. While the reason might be completely random you are determined to continue in the line of the second video. You want to make money and you want to make it fast. Our way of thinking is affected a lot by these metrics and our sole purpose is becoming to optimize them. As we try to optimize these metrics our virtues change because they might contradict with our objective function. . Most of the time we do follow the herd and do the same thing. We optimize the same objective function whether designed by us or other entities. We don’t question our actions and we just do them unconsciously. There is no quick way of getting popular, receiving praise or making money. Most of the numbers we look to optimize don’t make any sense and they are just consuming our soul. They make us lie, change our attitude, think uncritically and make unethical decisions. .",
